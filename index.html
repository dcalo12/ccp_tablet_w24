    <P>Fun facts because I need to fill space:</P>
    <ol>
        <li>The highest number between one (1) and one million (1,000,000) that does not contain the letter 'n' is eighty-eight (88).</li>
        <li>A "jiffy" is an actual measurement of time, it's a hundreth of a second (1/100 seconds).</li>
        <li>If you have 23 people in a room, there is roughly a 50% chance that two of them share a birthday.</li>
        <li>If you properly shuffle a deck of cards, it's almost guaranteed that that particular deck has never been shuffled before.</li>
        <li>Much to the dismay of Han Solo, a "parsec" is a unit of distance, not a unit of time. This means this his famous boast about completing "the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs" means he basically took a shortcut, since it's 20 parsecs wide. This is an error on George Lucas' part, and oddly enough is not one of the numerous things he edited in Star Wars.</li>
        <li>To tie into the previous fact, Lucas is infamous for editing his own work, such as making charcaters different species, adding more side characters to scenes, or recontextualizing entrire clips for fun.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I promise I'm not a huge nerd, I'm just trying my absolute hardest to fill this page up so that I can show to any grader that the "Skip to Main" function works without lazily spamming stuff on my keyboard</p>
    <p>Something I do want to say though, this class is like a breath of fresh air compared to my C++ classes. I'm a computer science major through the engineering school, and--excuse my French--it's Hell. These projects, maybe due to the languages I need to learn, are refreshing. It reminds me of when I first learned C++, without all of the scary Euchere crap.</p>
    <p>In case someone is actually taking the time to read all of this, I really like the staff of this class, at least the staff that I have had some form of direct contact with. Professor Wolf seems like a really cool lady who cares about what she teaches, and I respect that. She reminds me of a teacher I had back in high school, with how upbeat she is. Even if by some small chance it's just her acting like she cares, it's really convincing. It's enough to keep me engaged, and few instructors in  my experience can match that energy.</p> 
    <p>Rosalie is also doing a good job in her positon. Granted, we've only ever interacted all of three times in discussion, but like Professor Wolf, it's evident she cares about what she's teaching. I admit that maybe I'm a few steps ahead of her when she's giving out instructions, but she's just making sure everyone is at a comfortable pace. I'm really enjoying this class so far, and I hope I can apply what I learn here elsewhere in my career. </p>
    <p>I do need to make a habit of waking up early enough to make it to class, though. The last 2 lecctures I've either shown up late or not shown up at all. Not for lack of trying, I think I just have some sort of partial insomnia. There are random nights I can't seem to get any sleep. Or, when I do actually fall asleep, I manage to sleep through my nuclear [explosive incendiary device] siren of an alarm clock and only roll out of bed minutes before lecture ends. I don't want to lose points, so whatever lectures you guys plan to take attendence, I need to make sure I show up for.</p>
    <p>Finally, I mananged to blab enough to make the function have a visual effect when clicking it. At this point, I'm just typing to make it more apparent. I would ask what to put here, but I feel like I would just get told to "add whatever you want." So why bother asking, right?</p>
